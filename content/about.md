Hi, I'm Nisha. I graduated with a degree in Biochemistry from the University of Texas at Austin.

I graduated from the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science in 2017 and attended Texas A&M University for 1 year before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin where I finished my biochemistry degree. I find statistics and data science very interesting and enjoy using R.

I have worked as a medical scribe at Robin Healthcare, a company that strives to improve doctor-patient encounters by allowing the doctor to focus fully on the patient instead of on the computer. As a medical scribe, I watch the encounter, capture all of the relevant information, and upload it to the patient's EMR. Due to this job, I am skilled in different EMRs and medical terminology. 

My interests include reading, watching movies, listening to music, and writing short stories.
