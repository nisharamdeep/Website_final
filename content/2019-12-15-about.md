Hi, I'm Nisha. I'm a 3rd year biochemistry undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin.

I graduated from the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science in 2017 and attended Texas A&M University for 1 year before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin where I am currently in my 3rd year as a biochemistry major.

I currently work as a medical scribe at Robin Healthcare, a company that strives to improve doctor-patient encounters by allowing the doctor to focus fully on the patient instead of on the computer. As a medical scribe, I watch the encounter, capture all of the relevant information, and upload it to the patient's EMR. Due to this job, I am skilled in different EMRs and medical terminology. 

My interests include reading, watching movies, listening to music, and writing short stories.
