      <description>Hi, I&#39;m Nisha. I&#39;m a 3rd year biochemistry undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin.
I graduated from the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science in 2017 and attended Texas A&amp;amp;M University for 1 year before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin where I am currently in my 3rd year as a biochemistry major.
I currently work as a medical scribe at Robin Healthcare, a company that strives to improve doctor-patient encounters by allowing the doctor to focus fully on the patient instead of on the computer.</description>
