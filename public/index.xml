      <description>Using PythonIn class, we have been using Python to do a couple of interesting things. These include using regular expressions (regex) to find matches of certain characters in strings, almost like ctrl+f.
For example:
import restring = &amp;quot;We have to extract these numbers 12, 47, 48 The integers numbers are also interesting: 189 2036 314\&amp;#39;,\&amp;#39; is a separator, so please extract these numbers 125,789,1450 and also these 564,90456 We like to offer you 7890$ per month in order to complete this task.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&#39;m Nisha. I&#39;m a 3rd year biochemistry undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin.
I graduated from the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science in 2017 and attended Texas A&amp;amp;M University for 1 year before transferring to the University of Texas at Austin where I am currently in my 3rd year as a biochemistry major.
I currently work as a medical scribe at Robin Healthcare, a company that strives to improve doctor-patient encounters by allowing the doctor to focus fully on the patient instead of on the computer.</description>
