"0","string1 = r""We try to quantitatively capture these characteristics by defining a set of indexes,\
which can be computed using the mosaic image and the corresponding ground truth: \
\begin{itemize} \
    \item $\mu_{A_T}$ and $\sigma_{A_T}$, the mean and standard deviation of the tiles area $A_T$, respectively; \
    \item $\rho_\text{filler}$, the ratio between the filler area and the overall mosaic are, computed as \
$\rho_\text{filler}=\frac{\sum_{T \in \mathcal{T} A_T}}{A}$, being $A$ the area of the mosaic; \
    \item \todo{does it worth?}; \
    \item \todo{does it worth?}; \
    \item $\mu_{C_T}$, the mean of the tiles \emph{color dispersion} $C_T$, \
being $C_T = \sigma_R+\sigma_G+\sigma_B$, where $\sigma_R$, $\sigma_G$ and $\sigma_B$ are the \
standard deviation of the red, green and blue channel values of the pixels within the tile $T$.\
After applying a method to an image, we compare the segmented image (i.e., the result) \
against the ground truth and assess the performance according to the following three metrics: \
\begin{itemize} \
    \item average tile precision $P$ \
    \item average tile recall $R$ \
    \item tile count error $C$""
